In Florida construction, water is the enemy.
A classic afternoon thunderstorm drops 2 inches of rain in 45 minutes.
If you have a sloped yard, a drainage swale, or a lake bank... that water is taking your land with it.

We often get calls asking for "Hydro-seeding" or "mesh blankets."
But for residential and critical commercial applications, **Sod is the superior engineering solution.**

## Use Case: The "Hydro-Seed" Myth
Contractors love hydro-seed (spraying green green mulch-soup) because it feels cheap.
**The Reality:**
If it rains *one time* before the seed germinates (which takes 14 days), the seed washes into the drain.
We see sites hydro-seeded 3 or 4 times, still failing.
**Sod acts as "Instant Armor."**
It weighs 45 lbs per slab. It pins the earth down immediately.

## Best Grasses for Steep Slopes

### 1. The Anchor: Bahia Grass
**Best For:** Retention Ponds, Ditches, Roadsides.
Bahia is the "Rebar" of the grass world.
- **Deep Roots:** It sends roots down 2-3 feet quickly.
- **Drought Proof:** Once established, you never have to water it.
- **Cost:** It is the cheapest sod available.

### 2. The Carpet: Bermuda Grass
**Best For:** Swales, Golf Course mounds.
Bermuda grows via a dense web of "rhizomes" (underground runners).
- **Surface Friction:** Its density slows water velocity, preventing the water from scouring the dirt away.

## The "Staple" Technique
You can't just lay sod on a 45-degree hill. Gravity will pull it down.
We use **Bio-degradable Sod Staples**.
- These are 6-inch steel "U" pins.
- We pin every single piece of sod to the hill.
- Over 6 months, the staples rust away and disappear into the soil, but by then, the roots have taken over the job.

## Swale Management
Jacksonville relies on "Swales" (grassy ditches) to manage water.
If your swale holds water for days, the grass will rot.
**The Fix:**
1.  Verify the grade (ensure water flows downhill).
2.  Install sod, but **leave the soil 1 inch lower** than the concrete driveway. This prevents the sod from acting like a dam.
