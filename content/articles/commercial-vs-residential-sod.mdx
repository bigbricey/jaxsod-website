To a layperson, sod is sod. "Grass goes green side up."
To a Project Manager or GC, sod is the difference between getting a Certificate of Occupancy (CO) on Friday or paying liquidated damages on Monday.

Commercial sod installation is a completely different animal than residential work. It involves semi-truck logistics, strict safety protocols, and the ability to cover acres of ground in a single shift.
At Jax Sod, we specialize in high-stakes commercial installations. Here is why you need a Commercial Specialist, not just a guy with a truck.

## 1. The Logistics of Scale (The "Just In Time" Supply Chain)
A residential job uses 2 pallets. A commercial job might use 60 pallets (30,000 sq ft) in one day.

**The Heat Factor:**
Sod is a living, breathing perishable. Once cut, it begins to compost. Inside a pallet, internal temperatures can reach 120°F in hours.
- If 3 truckloads arrive at 7:00 AM, the sod on the 3rd truck will be dead by the time it is laid at 4:00 PM.
- **Our Strategy:** We stagger logistics. Truck 1 drops at 7:00 AM. Truck 2 drops at 10:00 AM. Truck 3 drops at 1:00 PM. The sod is never sitting. It goes from Farm to Ground in under 4 hours.

## 2. The "CO" Deadline (Speed Matters)
In commercial construction, landscaping is the *very last* thing to happen.
Usually, the sod is being laid while the painters are touching up the trim and the inspectors are walking the site.
We know the pressure.
- **Manpower:** We don't send a 2-man crew. We deploy 10-12 installers.
- **Equipment:** We utilize Moffett forklifts (all-terrain) to distribute pallets rapidly across rough job sites, keeping the crew moving forward.
- **Result:** We can turn a mud pit into a finished complex in 48 hours.

## 3. Commercial-Grade Durability
Commercial retention ponds and parking lot islands are hostile environments.
- **No Irrigation? No Problem:** Ideally, you have irrigation. But for retention ponds or roadsides, we often use **Argentine Bahia**. It is tough, drought-resistant, and stabilizes slopes to pass inspection without needing babying.
- **The "Big Roll" Advantage:** For large open fields (parks, sports complexes), we can install "Big Rolls" (42-inch wide rolls). This reduces seams by 60%, creating a smoother surface instantly and reducing weed intrusion.

## 4. Compliance & Safety (No Cowboy Stuff)
Commercial sites are regulated zones.
- **Insurance:** You need massive General Liability and Workers Comp policies to step foot on a commercial site. "Chuck in a Trick" is not insured for a $5M liability. We are.
- **PPE:** Our crews arrive in high-vis vests, steel-toe boots, and hard hats where required. We respect your safety protocols.
- **Plan Reading:** We don't guess. We follow the Landscape Architect's prints to the inch, ensuring swales drain correctly and property lines are respected.

## 5. Soil Transformation
Commercial sites are often "fill dirt"—compacted clay and construction debris.
Grass cannot grow in concrete.
Before a single piece of sod is laid, we bring in heavy-duty tillers and land planers. We rip the compacted surface to a depth of 4 inches, allowing water to infiltrate. If you skip this step (as low bidders do), the sod will look green for 2 weeks and then die when the roots hit the hardpan.
