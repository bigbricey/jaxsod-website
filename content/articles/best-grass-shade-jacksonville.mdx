Jacksonville is blessed with beautiful oak canopies. But those majestic trees create a challenge: shade. And shade is the enemy of most grass. If your lawn looks thin and patchy despite your best efforts, it's probably not your fault—it's a sunlight problem.
## How Much Shade is Too Much?
All grass needs *some* sunlight to photosynthesize. Here's the minimum:
- **Full sun grasses (Floratam, Bermuda):** Need 6-8 hours of direct sunlight
- **Shade-tolerant grasses (Palmetto, some Zoysia):** Need 4-6 hours of filtered/dappled sunlight
- **Dense shade (less than 4 hours):** No grass will consistently thrive
## The Best Shade-Tolerant Grasses for Jacksonville
### 1. Palmetto St. Augustine (Top Pick)
Palmetto is the gold standard for shade in Florida. It requires only 4-5 hours of sunlight per day and maintains good color even under moderate tree cover. It's also more cold-tolerant than Floratam, which matters in North Florida.
### 2. Seville St. Augustine
Seville is similar to Palmetto but with finer blades and slightly better shade tolerance. It's a great choice for upscale landscapes where you want both shade performance and aesthetics.
### 3. CitraBlue St. Augustine
A newer variety with excellent shade tolerance and improved disease resistance. It's gaining popularity in Florida and worth considering if you have had issues with fungal problems.
## When Grass Won't Work: Alternatives
If your yard has dense shade—under thick oak canopy, north side of the house—sometimes the honest answer is: **grass isn't going to work there.**
Rather than fighting a losing battle, consider:
- **Mulch beds:** Clean, low-maintenance, and actually looks intentional
- **Groundcover plants:** Asiatic jasmine, mondo grass, or ferns thrive in shade
- **Pine straw:** Common in Florida and matches the natural environment
- **Hardscape:** Pavers, stepping stones, or gravel paths
## Tips for Shade Lawn Success
- **Mow higher:** Set your mower to 4 inches. Taller grass has more leaf surface to capture limited sunlight.
- **Water less:** Shaded areas don't dry out as fast. Overwatering in shade invites fungus.
- **Thin your tree canopy:** A certified arborist can prune lower branches to let more light through.
- **Accept imperfection:** Shaded grass will never look as lush as full-sun grass. That's just reality.
