There is no pain quite like walking barefoot across your lush green lawn and suddenly feeling a needle stab into your heel.
You look down and see a tiny, brown, dried seed pod with a sharp spine.
**Congratulations, you have Burweed (Soliva sessilis).**

It is the scourge of Florida toes and dog paws. And here is the most frustrating part:
**By the time you feel the sticker in May, the plant is already dead.**

## Understanding the Enemy (The Lifecycle)
Burweed is a **Winter Annual**.
1.  **Germinates:** In the Fall (October/November) when temps drop.
2.  **Grows:** All winter long. It is low, green, and looks like a harmless fern. You don't even notice it.
3.  **Seeds:** In early Spring (March/April), it produces the seed pod (the sticker).
4.  **Dies:** In May/June, the heat kills the plant... leaving the hard, dry stickers behind to ruining your summer.

## The Strategy: Prevention is the ONLY Cure
You cannot "pull" burweed stickers out of the grass effectively. There are thousands of them.
You must prevent them from growing in the first place.

### The "Pre-Emergent" Window
You need to apply a **Pre-Emergent Herbicide** in the Fall.
- **Timing:** October 1st - November 15th (Before the first cold snap).
- **Product:** Look for *Isoxaben*, *Atrazine*, or *Dimension*.
- **Action:** This creates a chemical barrier on the soil. When the weed seeds try to sprout, they hit the barrier and die.

**If you miss this window, you WILL have stickers in the spring.**

### The "Rescue" Treatment (January - March)
If you forgot the pre-emergent, you have one last chance.
- **Inspect:** Look closely at your grass in Feb. Do you see little fern-like weeds?
- **Kill:** Spray a post-emergent herbicide (like *Weed-B-Gon* or *Atrazine*) **BEFORE** the stickers form.
- **Deadline:** Once the sticker forms (usually mid-March), spraying the weed kills the plant, *but the sticker remains hard and sharp.*

## What to Do Right Now (If It's Summer)
If you are reading this in June with a foot full of thorns... I'm sorry.
The plant is dead. Herbicide won't help.
**Your options:**
1.  **Bag Your Clippings:** Mow lower than usual and bag the clippings to suck up as many seeds as possible.
2.  **Intervention:** Fertilize your grass. A thick, healthy St. Augustine lawn will choke out next year's weeds naturally.
3.  **Wait:** The stickers will eventually decompose into the soil, but it takes months.

## Summary
- **Feel pain in May?** You failed in October.
- **Want a barefoot summer?** Set a calendar reminder: **"Apply Pre-Emergent Oct 15th."**

*Weed control is a year-round game. If you're tired of playing chemist, consider a professional lawn spray service to handle the timing for you.*
