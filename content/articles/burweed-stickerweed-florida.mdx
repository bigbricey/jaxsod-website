There's nothing quite like stepping on a burweed seed pod to ruin a beautiful Florida afternoon. These tiny torture devices hide in lawns across Jacksonville, attacking bare feet, pet paws, and anyone who dares to sit on the grass. Here's how to fight back.
## What Is Burweed (Lawn Burweed)?
Lawn burweed (*Soliva sessilis*), also called stickerweed or spurweed, is a winter annual weed. It germinates in fall, grows low to the ground all winter (often unnoticed), then produces its spiny seed pods in late spring. By the time those stickers hurt your feet in May, the weed has already completed its life cycle.
## Why Treating It Now (Spring/Summer) Is Too Late
Here's the frustrating truth: if you're stepping on stickers, the plant is already mature and dying. Spraying herbicide now will kill the plant, but the seeds are already on the ground—ready to germinate next fall and repeat the cycle.
**The key to burweed control is prevention, not reaction.**
## The Right Way: Pre-Emergent in Fall
The only effective way to prevent burweed is to stop the seeds from germinating. Apply a pre-emergent herbicide in **October or early November**, before the first cool nights.
Look for products containing:
- **Atrazine** (safe for St. Augustine and Centipede)
- **Isoxaben** 
- **Dithiopyr** 
Apply according to label rates. Water it in lightly. Mark your calendar now—this is a Fall job.
## Post-Emergent Options (If You Missed Fall)
If burweed is already growing (January-March), you can still treat it before the stickers form:
- **Atrazine:** Effective on young burweed in St. Augustine lawns.
- **2,4-D products:** Such as Weed B Gon or Weed Free Zone.
- **Timing matters:** Treat in January or February when plants are young. By March, the stickers are forming and you're too late.
## What To Do Right Now (If It's Already Summer)
- **Mow frequently:** Collect clippings to remove some seed pods from the lawn.
- **Set a reminder:** Put "Apply burweed pre-emergent" in your calendar for October.
- **Focus on lawn health:** A thick, healthy lawn crowds out weeds. Fertilize properly and water correctly.
## Can New Sod Help?
Yes and no. Fresh sod doesn't have burweed in it—but the seeds in your soil will find their way to the surface. New sod combined with a fall pre-emergent program gives you the best chance at a sticker-free lawn.
