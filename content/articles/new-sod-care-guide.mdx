You did it. You have a brand new, emerald-green lawn. It looks perfect.

But here is the hard truth: **New sod is on life support.**

When sod is harvested, 80% of its roots are cut off. For the next 30 days, your grass is in critical condition, fighting to re-grow those roots into your soil before its stored energy runs out.

If you water too little, it dies. If you water too much (at night), it rots.

This guide is your survival manual. Follow this **exact schedule**, and your lawn will thrive for decades.

## Phase 1: The "Soak-In" (Day 0-14)
**Goal:** Survival. Keep the leaves green and the soil muddy.

### Day 0: The Install Day
**CRITICAL:** Do not wait until the whole yard is done to start watering.
- As soon as a section is laid, soak it.
- **Target:** The water must penetrate through the sod pad and 1 inch into the native soil. It should feel "squishy" when you step on it.

### Day 1-7: The "Frequent Shallow" Routine
Your roots are only 1/2 inch long. Deep watering is useless because the roots can't reach it yet. You need *frequent* surface water to keep the leaves cool and the pad moist.
- **Frequency:** 2-3 times per day.
- **Schedule:** 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 2:00 PM.
- **Duration:** 15-20 minutes per zone (Rotors) / 5-8 minutes (Spray heads).
- **Pro Tip:** **NEVER water after 4:00 PM.** Water sitting on grass overnight is the #1 cause of fungus (Large Patch Disease) in Florida.

### Day 8-14: The "Transition" Routine
Tiny white roots are starting to form (The "Velcro" stage).
- **Frequency:** Once per day.
- **Schedule:** 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM range.
- **Duration:** Increase to 30-45 minutes per zone. We are starting to push water deeper to encourage roots to chase it.

## Phase 2: Establishment (Day 15-30)
**Goal:** Deep Rooting.

By Day 15, do the **Tug Test**. Pull up a corner. If it resists, you have roots! If it lifts easily, keep up the daily watering for another week.

### Mowing: The First Cut
**When:** Day 21 (or when grass is >5 inches tall).
**Rules:**
1.  **Sharp Blade:** Non-negotiable. A dull blade tears young grass, inviting disease.
2.  **High Cut:** Set your mower to the **MAX height**. You are just tipping it.
3.  **Dry Only:** Never mow wet, mushy sod. You will leave tire ruts that last forever.

### Watering Schedule
- **Week 3:** Every other day (3-4 days/week).
- **Week 4:** Twice a week (Standard St. Johns River Water Management District rules).

## 3 Critical Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. The "Set It and Forget It" Trap
Irrigation systems are not perfect. A wind gust or a clogged nozzle can leave a 5-foot dry spot.
> **The Fix:** Walk your lawn daily. Look for "blue-gray" footprints or curling leaves. Hand-water these hot spots immediately with a hose.

### 2. Fertilizing Too Soon
"I want it to grow fast!" So you dump Nitrogen on it.
**Result:** You burn the tender roots and force leaf growth when the plant *should* be focusing on root growth.
> **The Rule:** No fertilizer for 30-60 days. The farm already fertilized it.

### 3. Traffic Jam
Walking on saturated soil compacts it, squeezing out the oxygen roots need to breathe.
> **The Rule:** Keep kids, dogs, and delivery guys OFF for 14 days.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gaps between pieces** | Shrinkage due to dehydration. | Fill gaps with sand/potting soil to protect roots. Increase water. |
| **Brown edges** | Under-watering. Edges dry out first. | Hand-water the seams thoroughly. |
| **Mushy / Black slime** | Over-watering / Rot. | STOP watering. Let it dry out for 24 hours. |
| **Yellow circles** | Dog pee burns or Fungus. | If spreading, it's fungus—apply fungicide. If static, it's the dog. |

## FAQ: New Sod Questions

**Q: Can I put weed and feed on my new sod?**
**A:** **Absolutely NOT.** Herbicides (weed killers) are stressors. If you spray them on rootless sod, you can permanently stunt or kill it. Hand-pull weeds for the first 90 days.

**Q: My sod looks slightly yellow/green compared to my neighbor. Why?**
**A:** It's in shock. It was just severed from its roots and shipped on a truck. Give it 30 days of water and sun, and the deep green color will return naturally.

**Q: When can my dog play on it?**
**A:** Light walking (to go potty) is okay after 14 days. Full sprinting/fetch? Wait 30 days. Big dogs can tear up the sod pieces before they are anchored.

**Q: How long until I can drive on it?**
**A:** Do not drive on your lawn. But if you must (maintenance trucks), wait at least 60 days for the soil compaction to stabilize.
