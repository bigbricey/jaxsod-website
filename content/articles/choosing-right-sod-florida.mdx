Florida is a paradise for humans, but it can be a battlefield for grass. With our scorching subtropical sun, sandy nutrient-poor soil, salt air, and oppressive humidity, only the toughest grass varieties survive. But survival isn't enough—you want a lawn that *thrives*.
Choosing the right sod is the single most important decision you will make for your landscape. Pick the right one, and you'll have a low-maintenance oasis. Pick the wrong one (like planting a shade-intolerant grass under an oak tree), and you are guaranteed to be replacing it within two years.
When you are ready to move forward, our [Residential Sod Installation](/services) team can handle the entire process for you.
At Jax Sod, we believe an informed customer is a happy customer. This guide breaks down the "Big Four" grass families used in Jacksonville and Northeast Florida: St. Augustine, Zoysia, Bahia, and Bermuda. We will explore the specific cultivars, pros and cons, and best use cases for each.
## 1. St. Augustine Grass: The Florida Classic
If you drive through any subdivision in Jacksonville, 90% of the lawns you see are St. Augustine grass. It is the gold standard for a reason. It produces that wide-bladed, deep blue-green, lush "carpet" look that most homeowners desire.
### The Varieties
- **Floratam:** The king of Florida lawns. It loves the sun and grows aggressively, choking out weeds. However, it has very poor shade tolerance and poor cold tolerance. If you have wide-open sun, this is your best bet.
- **Palmetto:** A dwarf variety with a finer texture and a deeper green color. Its superpower is shade tolerance. It can survive with 4-5 hours of sunlight, whereas Floratam needs 6-8. It also handles cold snaps better.
- **Seville:** A niche variety for heavy shade. It has a dwarf growth habit and excellent color retention, but it is softer and less wear-tolerant than Floratam.
- **CitraBlue:** A newer variety developed by the University of Florida. It has a distinctive blue-green hue and requires less fertilizer and mowing than older varieties.
### Pros & Cons
**The Good:**
- Highest shade tolerance (specific varieties).
- Excellent salt tolerance (great for coastal homes).
- Lush, dense growth that blocks weeds.
**The Bad:**
- High water requirement.
- Prone to Chinch Bugs (a major pest).
- Prone to fungus in high humidity.
- Not great for heavy foot traffic.
## 2. Zoysia Grass: The Premium Up-and-Comer
Zoysia has exploded in popularity over the last decade. It offers a "golf course" look with finer blades and a soft feel underfoot. It is often marketed as the "maintenance-free" grass, which is a myth, but it *is* generally hardier than St. Augustine.
### The Varieties
- **Empire Zoysia:** The most common Zoysia in Florida. It has a wider blade (for a Zoysia) and is incredibly durable. It handles drought better than St. Augustine because it goes dormant (turns brown) to protect itself, then bounces back green when watered.
- **Icon / Zeon:** Fine-bladed varieties that look truly luxurious. They are often used on high-end properties. They require a reel mower to look their absolute best but can be maintained with a sharp rotary mower.
### Pros & Cons
**The Good:**
- Feels like carpet; best barefoot grass.
- Excellent traffic tolerance (kids and dogs).
- Chinch bug resistant.
- Better cold tolerance than St. Augustine.
**The Bad:**
- More expensive upfront cost.
- Slower recovery from damage (grows slower).
- Thatch buildup requires vertical mowing (dethatching) every few years.
## 3. Bahia Grass: The Rural Utility Player
Bahia is the pasture grass of the South. You see it on roadsides and on acreages. It is not an ornamental grass—it doesn't look like a manicured lawn—but it is nearly indestructible.
### The Varieties
- **Argentine:** The preferred choice for lawns. It has wider blades and a darker green color. It produces fewer of the ugly "Y" shaped seed heads than other types.
- **Pensacola:** Used mostly for highway medians and erosion control. Not recommended for residential lawns due to its pale color and prolific seed head production.
### Pros & Cons
**The Good:**
- Cheapest sod option.
- Incredible drought tolerance (deep root system).
- Needs very little fertilizer.
- Resists almost all bugs and diseases.
**The Bad:**
- Aesthetically "messy" look.
- Rapid seed head production dulls mower blades.
- Poor shade tolerance (needs full sun).
- Open growth habit allows weeds to mix in.
## 4. Bermuda Grass: The Athlete
Bermuda is the grass of golf courses and sports fields. It is designed to be cut low and run on. For a residential lawn, it requires a high level of maintenance to look good.
### Pros & Cons
**The Good:**
- Repairability: It spreads aggressively to fill in bare spots.
- Traffic Tolerance: The toughest grass for wear and tear.
- Beautiful fine texture when mowed low.
**The Bad:**
- Highest maintenance (needs frequent mowing and fertilizing).
- Zero shade tolerance.
- invasive: It will grow into your flower beds and neighbor's yard.
## Decision Framework: How to Choose
Don't pick based on pictures alone. Pick based on your property's reality.
#### Do you have large oak trees?
**Answer:** You need St. Augustine (Palmetto or Seville). Zoysia and Bermuda will slowly thin out and die in the shade.
#### Do you have big dogs and kids playing soccer?
**Answer:** You need Zoysia (Empire) or Bermuda. St. Augustine is too fragile for heavy claw traffic.
#### Do you have no irrigation system?
**Answer:** You need Bahia. It's the only one that will reliably survive on rainfall alone once established.
#### Do you want the best-looking lawn on the block?
**Answer:** St. Augustine (Floratam) or Zoysia (Empire), provided you commit to the watering and fertilization schedule.
