Imagine building a luxury home on a foundation of loose sand and rubble. It doesn't matter how expensive the house is; it will eventually crack and fail.
The same principle applies to your lawn. The sod you buy is the "house," but the soil preparation is the "foundation."

At Jax Sod, we treat soil preparation as the most critical phase of the project. It is the one step you cannot *undo* once the grass is down.
Many homeowners (and cut-rate installers) rush this stage to get to the "instant green" gratification, only to find their new lawn struggling with root rot or air pockets months later.

In this deep dive, we pull back the curtain on the professional preparation process.

## Phase 1: Demolition (The "Clean Slate")

You cannot paint over a dirty canvas. To install new sod, the old organic material must be removed.

### The Problem with "Spraying and Praying"
The lazy method is to spray weeds with Roundup, wait for them to turn brown, and lay sod on top.
**Why this fails:**
1.  **Decomposition:** The dead weeds rot underneath, creating heat and slime that can kill new roots.
2.  **Elevation Issues:** Sod has 1 inch of dirt attached. If you lay it on top of old grass, you raise your yard grade by 1 inch. Do this twice, and you block your drainage.

### The Professional Method: Sod Cutting
We use a mechanical **Sod Cutter**, a heavy machine that slices a uniform layer of earth 1 to 2 inches below the surface.
- **Weed Elimination:** By cutting below the "crown," we remove the reproductive parts of the weed.
- **Thatch Removal:** Old lawns have a layer of "thatch" (dead organic matter) that acts like a barrier. We strip it all away to expose the raw mineral soil.

## Phase 2: Surface Smoothing (Not "Grading")

Terminology matters.
- **Grading:** Changing the slope of the land to alter water flow (Requires engineering/permits).
- **Smoothing:** Refining the existing surface to ensure it is flat and level.

We perform meticulous **Surface Smoothing**.
- **Debris Clearing:** We rake out rocks, large sticks, and construction debris. A rock the size of a golf ball left under sod will feel like a boulder when you step on it, and it will scalp your mower blade forever.
- **The "Tabletop" Finish:** We use landscape rakes and drag mats to pull soil from high spots to low spots. The goal is a surface flat enough to play billiards on.

## Phase 3: Soil Amendments (The Secret Sauce)

Jacksonville soil is often just grey sand. It drains instantly (good) but holds zero nutrients (bad).

### Should You Add Topsoil?
Only if your yard is pure beach sand. If you have "dirty sand" (grey/black), you are usually fine for St. Augustine.
**Warning:** Adding topsoil changes your drainage. If you add 2 inches of dirt, you might send rainwater flowing into your garage.

### The Pro Tip: Starter Fertilizer
Instead of bulk dirt, we apply a specific **Starter Fertilizer** (High Phosphorus) directly to the soil *before* the sod is laid.
- **Why?** Phosphorus promotes root growth but moves VERY slowly through soil (1 inch per year). By putting it *under* the sod, we put the food right where the roots will be.

## Phase 4: The Final Roll

Preparation involves one final step *after* installation: **Rolling.**
Roots cannot grow through air.
If you don't roll the sod, there are tiny air gaps between the sod pad and your soil. The roots hit that air gap, dry out, and stop growing.
We use a heavy water-filled drum roller to press the sod down, ensuring **100% soil-to-soil contact**.

## FAQ: Soil Prep Mistakes

**Q: Can I just rototill the weeds under?**
**A:** **No.** Rototilling chops the weeds up and replants them. Nutsedge and Dollarweed love this; you are just spreading them. You must *remove* the vegetation, not bury it.

**Q: Do I need to kill the grass before you cut it out?**
**A:** Ideally, yes. Spraying a non-selective herbicide 7-10 days before we arrive ensures that any deep roots we miss are dead. However, mechanical removal is 90% of the battle.

**Q: What about my sprinkler heads?**
**A:** We flag all heads before we start cutting. However, old heads are often buried. We recommend having a few spare irrigation heads on hand, as site prep often reveals broken or leaking pipes that need fixing anyway.
