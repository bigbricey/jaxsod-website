Watering seems simple. Turn knob, water comes out, grass grows. Right?
**Wrong.**

Improper irrigation is the #1 killer of sod in Florida.
Water too little? Dead.
Water too much? Fungus.
Water at the wrong time? Disease.

To maintain a drought-tolerant, disease-free lawn, you must follow the laws of botany. Here are the **Golden Rules.**

## Rule #1: The 4:00 AM Start Time
The single best time to water is between **4:00 AM and 8:00 AM.**

**Why Morning?**
1.  **Wind is Calm:** In the afternoon, wind blows your water onto the driveway. In the morning, it hits the grass aimed.
2.  **Disease Prevention:** This is critical. If you water at 6:00 PM, your grass sits wet all night in the dark. Warm + Wet + Dark = **Fungus** (Large Patch Disease). Morning watering allows the sun to dry the blades quickly.

**The Rule:** NEVER water between 4:00 PM and Midnight.

## Rule #2: Deep & Infrequent
You want to train your roots to go *down*. Roots follow the moisture.

**The Rookie Mistake:** Watering for 10 minutes every day.
*   **Result:** The water only penetrates 1 inch deep. The roots stay in the top 1 inch. When a hot day comes, that top inch dries out in an hour, and your lawn dies.

**The Pro Method:** Water for 45-60 minutes, twice a week.
*   **Result:** The water soaks 6-8 inches deep. The roots must dive down to find it. You build a massive, drought-tolerant root system that can survive days without rain.

## Rule #3: The "Tuna Can" Calibration
A digital timer that says "30 Minutes" means nothing.
- Zone A might have high-power Rotors (slow water).
- Zone B might have Spray Heads (fast water).
30 minutes on Zone B is a flood; 30 minutes on Zone A is a drought.

**The Diagnostic Test:**
1.  Eat some tuna (or get empty cat food cans).
2.  Place 3-4 cans around your specific zone.
3.  Run the system for 30 minutes.
4.  Measure the water depth.
**Target:** You want **3/4 inch of water** per session.
*   If you only have 1/4 inch? You need to run that zone for 90 minutes.

## Rule #4: Watch the Weather & The Law
Jacksonville (St. Johns River Water Management District) has strict laws.
- **Summer (DST):** Two days per week.
- **Winter (EST):** One day per week.
- **Never:** Between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (Evaporation is too high).

**Pro Tip:** Install a **Rain Sensor**. It is required by Florida law. It shuts off your system when we get a thunderstorm, saving you money and saving your roots from rot.

## FAQ: Irrigation Troubleshooting

**Q: My grass is crunching when I walk on it.**
**A:** That is "wilt." The leaves are dehydrated. Run a manual cycle immediately (even if it's afternoon) to save it, then check your coverage.

**Q: I have a wet spot that never dries.**
**A:** You likely have a weeping valve or a broken pipe underground. Turn off your main water to the irrigation and see if the meter stops spinning.

**Q: Brown circles are appearing.**
**A:** If you are watering correctly, this is likely Fungus (too much water) or Chinch Bugs (not enough). Do the "Tug Test" on the dead grass to see if roots are intact.
