## The Science of Watering
Watering your lawn seems simple: turn on the hose, get it wet, turn it off. However, in Florida's sandy soil and intense heat, improper irrigation is the #1 killer of sod. Shallow watering encourages shallow roots. Evening watering encourages fungus. To maintain a drought-tolerant, disease-free lawn, you must follow the "Golden Rules" of irrigation.
## Rule #1: The 4:00 AM Start Time
The single best time to water your lawn is between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM.
#### Why Morning?
- **Wind is calm:** The water goes where you aim it, not onto your driveway.
- **Evaporation is low:** The water has time to soak into the root zone before the sun burns it off.
- **Disease Prevention:** This is critical. If you water in the evening (6 PM - 10 PM), your grass stays wet all night. Warm, wet, dark conditions are a petri dish for Fungus (Large Patch, Grey Leaf Spot). By watering in the morning, the sun dries the blades quickly, preventing disease.
## Rule #2: Deep and Infrequent
Your goal is to train your grass roots to grow deep. Roots follow the water.
**The Wrong Way:** Watering for 10 minutes every day. This keeps the top inch of soil wet. The roots have no reason to dig deeper. When a drought comes (or you miss a day), these shallow roots fry, and your lawn dies.
**The Right Way:** Water for 45-60 minutes, twice a week. This "Deep Soak" forces water 6-8 inches down into the soil. The roots must stretch down to find it. This creates a robust, drought-tolerant root system that can survive days without water.
## Rule #3: The "Tuna Can" Calibration
A timer setting of "30 minutes" means nothing. One zone might have high-flow rotors, another might have mist heads. You need to measure the *volume* of water, not the time.
**The Test:** Place empty tuna cans (or straight-sided coffee mugs) around your lawn. Run your sprinklers for 30 minutes. Measure the water depth in the cans.
<li>**Target:** You want **3/4 inch** of water per session.</li>
- **Math:** If you get 1/4 inch in 30 minutes, you need to run that zone for 90 minutes to get the proper soak. Adjust your timer accordingly.
## Rule #4: Watch the Weather (and the Law)
Jacksonville (St. Johns River Water Management District) has strict watering restrictions.
<li>During Daylight Savings Time (Spring/Summer): You may water **twice a week** on your designated days.</li>
<li>During Eastern Standard Time (Fall/Winter): You may water **once a week**.</li>
- **Never water between 10 AM and 4 PM.** It is wasteful and illegal.
Also, install a **Rain Sensor**. It is required by Florida law on all automated systems. It shuts off your system after heavy rain, saving you money and saving the grass from root rot.
## Summary
Irrigation is not "set it and forget it." It is a tool. Use it wisely. Deep, infrequent, morning watering is the secret to the lush, green lawns you see in magazines.
