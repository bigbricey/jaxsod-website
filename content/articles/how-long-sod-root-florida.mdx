You've invested in beautiful new sod. Now you're staring at your lawn wondering: "When can I walk on it? When can I mow? When is it actually 'rooted'?" Here's the timeline you need.
## The Rooting Timeline
### Days 1-7: Critical Establishment
The sod is sitting on top of the soil, held in place by its own weight. Roots are just beginning to reach into the ground. This is the most vulnerable period—consistent watering is non-negotiable.
### Days 7-14: Initial Rooting
If you gently tug on a corner, you'll feel some resistance. Fine roots are anchoring into the soil. You can reduce watering frequency slightly, but don't stop.
### Days 14-21: Light Foot Traffic OK
The sod should no longer lift when pulled. You can walk on it to retrieve the mail or water. Avoid concentrated traffic (like a dog running the same path repeatedly).
### Days 21-30: First Mow
Once the grass blades reach 4-5 inches, it's time to mow. Never cut more than 1/3 of the blade height. Use a sharp mower—dull blades tear new grass.
### Days 30-60: Fully Established
In Florida's growing season, your sod should be fully rooted within 30-60 days. The seams are invisible, the lawn is uniform, and it can handle normal use.
## Factors That Speed Up (or Slow Down) Rooting
- **Temperature:** Warm soil (70-90°F) = fast rooting. Cool soil (below 60°F) = slow or stalled.
- **Watering:** Consistent moisture is essential. Dry roots don't grow.
- **Soil Contact:** Proper rolling during installation eliminates air pockets. Poor contact = slow roots.
- **Grass Type:** Bermuda roots fastest. Zoysia is slowest. St. Augustine is in the middle.
- **Season:** Spring/summer = 2-3 weeks. Winter = 6-8 weeks (or until spring warmth arrives).
## The "Tug Test"
The simplest way to check if your sod is rooted: grab a corner and give it a firm tug. If it lifts easily, it's not rooted. If it resists and feels anchored, the roots have taken hold.
Be patient. A little extra time before heavy use means years of healthy lawn ahead.
