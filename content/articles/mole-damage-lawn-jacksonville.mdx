You wake up one morning to find your pristine lawn crisscrossed with raised ridges, like someone ran a network of underground highways beneath your grass.
Welcome to the world of **mole damage**—one of the most frustrating lawn problems facing Jacksonville homeowners.

Moles are small mammals with paddle-like front paws designed for swimming through soil.
**Myth Buster:** They do *not* eat your grass. They are carnivores. They eat bugs.
**The Problem:** In their hunt for food, they tunnel just below the surface, severing your grass roots from the soil and killing the lawn from below.

Here is the definitive guide to fighting back.

## Step 1: Confirm It's a Mole
Don't declare war on the wrong enemy.

**Signs of Moles:**
- **The "Volcano":** Cone-shaped mounds of loose dirt pushed up from deep tunnels.
- **The "Ridge":** Raised tunnels you can see running across the lawn.
- **The "Squish":** When you walk, your foot sinks into soft, hollow ground.

**Signs of Armadillos (The Imposter):**
- Shallow holes dug *from the top down*.
- No tunnels.
- Looks like a dog was digging for a bone.

## Step 2: Understand the "Why" ( The Grub Connection)
Moles don't like your yard because of the view. They like it because it's an **All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.**
The primary food source for moles in Florida is **Grubs** (beetle larvae), followed by earthworms and mole crickets.

**The Golden Rule of Mole Control:**
**If you have moles, you typically have grubs.**
If you kill the food source (grubs), the moles will move to your neighbor's yard to find dinner.

## Control Strategy: The 2-Pronged Attack

### 1. Eliminate the Food (Grub Control)
This is the long-term fix.
- **Product:** Use a granular Grub Killer (look for *Dylox* or *Imidacloprid*).
- **Timing:** Apply in May/June (preventative) or whenever you see damage.
- **Result:** It takes a few weeks, but as the grubs die, the mole activity will decrease.

### 2. Physical Removal (Trapping)
This is the immediate fix.
- **Trap Types:** Harpoon traps or Scissor traps are the only effective method.
- **Placement:** You must find an "active run." Step on a tunnel to flatten it. Check it 24 hours later. If it is pushed back up, that is an active highway. Place the trap there.
- **Useless Junk:** Do not buy "Sonic Spikes," "Vibrating stakes," or "Mole Repellent Castor Oil." University studies show these do absolutely nothing.

## Repairing the Damage: "The Stomp"
Once the mole is gone, you still have an ugly lawn.

**For Surface Tunnels:**
1.  **Step on them.** Use your body weight to press the sod back down against the soil.
2.  **Water heavily.** The water helps the soil settle and eliminates the air pockets.
3.  **Wait.** If the roots weren't dried out for too long, the grass might re-attach.

**For Dead Patches:**
If the grass is brown and crispy, the roots are dead. You need to cut out that strip (use a bread knife) and lay a fresh piece of sod patch.

## FAQ: Mole Warfare

**Q: Can I use poison gummy worms?**
**A:** Sometimes. Products like *Talpirid* (look like gummy worms) can work if placed *inside* the tunnel correctly. But moles are hunters; they prefer live prey. Traps are generally more reliable.

**Q: Are moles protected by law?**
**A:** No. In Florida, moles are considered nuisance pests. You can legally trap them on your property.

**Q: Will my cat verify kill them?**
**A:** Some cats are great mole hunters. But relying on "Fluffy" is not a scalable strategy.
