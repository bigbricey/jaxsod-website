Reference: You just bought a $600,000 new home.
Why does the lawn look like a disaster 6 months later?

We call it the **"Builder Grade Special."**
In the rush to close homes, builders often treat landscaping as an afterthought. They hire the lowest bidder, lay the cheapest grass on top of construction rubble, and move to the next lot.

## The 3 Sins of Builder Sod

### 1. No Prep (The Rubble Layer)
Builders rarely grade or till the soil. They just scrape it with a bulldozer.
We often find buried concrete chunks, 2x4s, and stucco buckets *directly under* the sod.
**Result:** The grass grows for 2 weeks (living off the sod farm soil), then the roots hit a piece of concrete or hardpan clay, and it dies.

### 2. The Cheapest Cultivar
Builders usually install "Floratam" St. Augustine everywhere because it is cheap.
**The Problem:** They put it in the shady alleys between 2-story houses.
Floratam needs 6+ hours of sun. The alley gets 2 hours.
**Result:** The sides of your house turn to mud within 3 months.

### 3. The "Gap" Installation
High-volume crews don't butt the seams together tightly. They leave 1-inch gaps.
**Result:** Weeds sprout in the gaps immediately. Your brand new lawn is full of weeds before you even move in.

## How to Protect Your Investment

### Scenario A: Before Closing (The Credit)
Smart homeowners ask the builder for a **Landscape Credit.**
"Don't sod the yard. Give me a credit for the cost, and I will hire my own pro."
- **Why do this?** We can come in, till the soil, remove the trash, grade it perfectly, and install the *correct* grass (like Palmetto for those shady alleys).

### Scenario B: After Closing (The Rescue)
If you already own the home and the grass is failing:
**Do not wait.**
The most common mistake is waiting 2 years.
"Maybe it will come back."
It won't. The soil prep was skipped.
The sooner you fix it, the sooner you stop tracking red clay mud into your new living room.

## The Inspection Checklist
If you are doing a final walkthrough with your builder, check these items:
1.  **Pull up a corner:** Is there black soil underneath, or hard clay/rocks?
2.  **Check the Edges:** Is the sod flush with the driveway, or is it 3 inches higher? (Tripping hazard).
3.  **Irrigation:** Turn it on. Does it actually cover the corners? (Builders often miss the corners).

## FAQ: New Construction Questions

**Q: Can I require the builder to fix the sod?**
**A:** If you are still within your 1-year home warranty, yes. Report the dead spots. However, be aware they will likely just patch it with the same cheap grass without fixing the underlying soil problem.

**Q: Should I install gutters first?**
**A:** YES. 100% Yes. Without gutters, the roof runoff hits the ground with hydraulic force, digging a trench in your new sod along the drip line.

**Q: How long should I wait for the ground to settle?**
**A:** Construction sites settle for 6-12 months. If you install high-end landscaping immediately, you might need to top-dress (add sand) a year later to level out the low spots that appear as the buried trash decomposes.
