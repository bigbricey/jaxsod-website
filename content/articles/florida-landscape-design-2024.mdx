Most DIY landscapes fail for one reason: **Impulse Buying.**
You go to the big box store in April, buy whatever is blooming, and stick it in the ground.
By July, it is dead from the heat. Or by January, it is black mush from a freeze.

Jacksonville is a unique climate zone (Zone 9a/9b). We are sub-tropical, but we get freezes. The plants that work in Miami often die here. The plants that work in Atlanta burn up here.
Here is the professional guide to designing a landscape that actually survives.

## Rule #1: The 3-Layer Design
Good landscape design is not about individual plants; it is about "Layering."
Imagine your yard as a stage. You need a backdrop, a middle ground, and a front row.

### Layer 1: The Backbone (Foundation Shrubs)
These are the green walls. They hide your A/C unit, soften the house corners, and look good 365 days a year.
**The Bulletproof Pick: Podocarpus.**
- It is the ultimate vertical screen. It grows straight up, is pest-free, and can be trimmed into a tight column.
- **Runner Up:** **Viburnum Odoratissimum.** Big, glossy leaves. Grows fast.

### Layer 2: The Texture (Mid-Height)
This is where we add interesting shapes.
**The Bulletproof Pick: Loropetalum (Plum variety).**
- We need contrast. If everything is green, it is boring. Loropetalum offers deep purple foliage that pops against green grass.
- **Runner Up:** **Foxtail Ferns.** Bright lime green, structural, and tough as nails.

### Layer 3: The Color (Low Groundcover)
This is the "jewelry" of the yard.
**The Bulletproof Pick: Flax Lily (Dianella).**
- Strappy, variegated leaves (white and green stripes). It brightens up shady spots and barely needs water.
- **Runner Up:** **Blue Daze.** Small blue flowers that love the heat.

## Rule #2: "Right Plant, Right Place" (The Sun Map)
This is where 90% of money is wasted.
- **Crotons:** They are beautiful and tropical. **BUT** if you plant them in an open yard in Jacksonville, the first hard freeze (28°F) will melt them. They must be planted *close to the house* on the South side for warmth.
- **Azaleas:** They hate "wet feet." If you put them near a downspout, they will rot.

## Rule #3: Grouping (The Rule of odd Numbers)
This is the secret that makes a landscape look "Professional."
**Never plant one of anything.**
- One plant looks like a mistake.
- Three plants look like a design.
- Five plants look like a "drift."
Always plant in odd numbers (3, 5, 7). It tricks the eye into seeing a cohesive mass, not individual dots.

## Pro Tip: The "Mulch Trap"
Don't use Cypress Mulch. It floats away in heavy rain.
**Use Pine Bark (Mini-Nuggets).**
- It stays in place better.
- It breaks down to acidify the soil (which our plants love).
- It is a renewable industry byproduct, unlike cypress trees which are often harvested unsustainably.

## FAQ: Landscape Logic

**Q: What is Zone 9a vs 9b?**
**A:** Jacksonville is right on the line. 9a (Westside/Northside) gets colder, regularly hitting 25-30°F. 9b (Beaches/Sampson Creek) stays slightly warmer due to the ocean/river breeze. *Always design for 9a to be safe.*

**Q: Can I plant in the Summer?**
**A:** Ideally, no. The best time to plant is spring or fall. If you plant in July, you must water EVERY single day to keep the root ball from frying in the 95°F heat.

**Q: Do you use river rocks instead of mulch?**
**A:** We use them sparingly. Rocks absorb heat and can cook the roots of delicate plants. They are great for drainage swales, but for plant beds, pine bark is healthier for the soil.
