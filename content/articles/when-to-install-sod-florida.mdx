A common myth in Jacksonville is that "Sod Season" ends when summer ends.
**False.**
Unlike the frozen North, Florida’s sub-tropical climate allows us to install sod **12 months a year.**

However, the *strategy* changes depending on the month. Installing in July requires a totally different game plan than installing in January.

Here is the professional breakdown of when to pull the trigger.

## 1. Spring (March – May)
**Status:** The "Goldilocks" Zone.
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect)

This is the peak season. The soil temps are rising (triggering root growth), but the air isn't scorching hot yet.
- **Pros:** Fast rooting (14 days). Optimal growth.
- **Cons:** Demand is high. Install dates book out weeks in advance, and sod farms sometimes run low on inventory.
- **Strategy:** Book early. Aim for April if possible.

## 2. Summer (June – August)
**Status:** The High-Risk / High-Reward Zone.
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Good, but stressful)

Grass loves heat + water. It grows incredibly fast in summer. But sod on a pallet is a ticking time bomb.
- **Pros:** Fastest establishment. You can have a rooted lawn in 10 days.
- **Cons:** **The "Cook" Factor.** If sod sits on the pallet for 24 hours, it will compost and die. You absolutely MUST have your irrigation dialed in. If you miss one day of watering, the lawn dies.
- **Risks:** Fungus pressure is high due to humidity.
- **Strategy:** Install immediately upon delivery. Double-check your sprinkler coverage before the grass arrives.

## 3. Fall (September – November)
**Status:** The "Secret Best Time."
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

Locals know this is the best time to garden. The air is drier, pests are dying off, but the ground is still warm.
- **Pros:** Less water required than summer. Less weed competition.
- **Cons:** Shorter days mean slower leaf growth.
- **Strategy:** Great for St. Augustine replacement. Get it down before Thanksgiving so it roots before the first frost.

## 4. Winter (December – February)
**Status:** The "Dormant" Install.
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Safe, but ugly)

Can you lay sod in January? Yes. New construction homes do it every day.
- **Pros:** **Lowest maintenance.** You almost never have to water it. It just sits there. It won't die from lack of water.
- **Cons:** **It won't turn green.** It will lay there, brown/dormant, until March. Roots grow very slowly.
- **Risk:** If we get a hard freeze (20s) *right* after install, the tender roots can be damaged.
- **Strategy:** If you have aMud pit, do it. It stops erosion. If you want instant beauty, wait for March.

## Key Factor: Soil Temperature

Roots don't care about air temperature; they care about **soil temperature**.

| Soil Temp | Root Activity | Season |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **> 85°F** | Heat Stress (Needs lots of water) | July/Aug |
| **70°F - 80°F** | 🚀 Peak Growth (Optimal) | April/May/Oct |
| **< 55°F** | Dormancy (Sleep mode) | Jan/Feb |

## Summary: When should YOU install?

**If you have an Irrigation System:**
You can install **any time**. Just adjust your water schedule (Heavy in Summer, Light in Winter).

**If you depend on Hose Sprinklers:**
Wait for the **Rainy Season (June-August)** or **Spring**. Trying to hand-water a lawn in a dry October is misery.

**If you are selling your house:**
Do it **NOW**. A green lawn adds immediate value, regardless of the season.
